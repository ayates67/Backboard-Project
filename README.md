# Backboard-Project

# Project outline
For this project, we want to make a basketball backboard.
We hope to have either a homemade backboard or online backboard and a rim.
We will create code to have a counter that counts when a basket is made.
The backboard will have a display screen with the running number of baskets.
We will use an ultrasonic sensor for the backboard.
We will have a button on the device that will make the running counter reset to 0.

# Goals for the project
Goals for the project:
To make a durable and useful backboard.
To make something that other people can have fun with.
To write our own code.
To learn how to design something and use code at the same time.
